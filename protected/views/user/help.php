        <p class="size4">What is CSchedule?
        </p>

        <p>
            CSchedule is an app for people to organize scheduled events or activities. It allows the organizer to share
            schedules among participants and send out reminders (email and push notifications on mobile platforms) to
            those on the schedule. It also allows participants of an activity to contact each other very easily.
        </p>
        <p class="size4">How do I use CSchedule?</p>

        <p>If you're the organizer of an activity:
        </p>

        <p>Step 1: Enter your contacts <br/>
            Step 2: Create an activity. <br/>
            Step 3: Go to the activity info page to add contacts into "Participant" on the activity so they can be
            assigned on duty. <br/>
            Step 4: Create schedules for your activity and assign participants on duty.</p>

        <p>If you are a participant in an activity:</p>

        <p>Step 1: Browse your activities and schedules to see which activities you are have been invited to. <br/>
            Step 2: Confirm or deny your participation in an activity.<br/>
            Step 3: Communicate with other participants of an activity via email, phone call or text message by click on
            the name of participant on the mobile phone app.</p>
